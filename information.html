              </svg> What is COVID-19?</b>  
            <p class='ml-2'>COVID-19, or the Coronavirus Disease, was discovered in 2019, and is a virus that became rampant in 2020.</p>
        </div>  
        <br>

            <b>Brief History of COVID-19 in the US (2020)</b>
            <ul>
                <li>The first case appeared on the January 20th, 2020, and the first death was on February 29th, 2020. </li>
                <li>It was in March that the virus was declared a pandemic and Americans began to quarantine. Schools implemented remote learning and workforces were instructed 
                    to continue remotely if possible, which also led to 3.3 million Americans to file for unemployment benefits as in March. </li>
                <li>By April; four months after appearing in the US, cases surpassed one million, and deaths from the virus reached 60,000. </li>
                <li>By July; cases surpassed three million, and deaths reached 150,000. 
                    A difference of two million cases and almost 100,000 in just two months. </li>
                <li>By September; deaths reached 200,000. </li>
                <li>By the end of 2020, deaths from COVID-19 had reached 300,000 in the US alone and one million worldwide.</li>
                <li>By January 2021; it is still an issue in most countries of the world.</li>
            </ul>
        <br>

        <b>Symptoms</b>
        <p>COVID-19 has an incubation period of up to two weeks, meaning the body can be infected and spread to other people and still not show any symptoms. </p>
        <p>COVID-19 shares many of its symptoms with the flu, however, some key differences between the two are that COVID-19 is more serious and deadly, spreads easier, and has a 
        longer incubation period, which makes it easier to miss in the beginning. The symptoms they share include from most commonly:</p>
        <ul>
